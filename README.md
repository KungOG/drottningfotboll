# drottningfotboll

'Drottning Fotboll' is played normally in Sweden after season. Football is my hobby aside from everything and I've been doing so for a very long time. And since I started to get into coding there have been problems I would like to solve, this is for one.

'Drottning Fotboll' is a locally term that we use after season and it is usually that people come and try out in different teams, but it is done analog today. This website is here to change that, today you divide up the players into different groups, usually with a deck of cars and depends on what French suits you get. That's how you randomize the teams. After this you write every group (players) onto a paper and then you keep track on which team wins and then you add points to the players in the respective winning team (there is always a game winner).

After this you then have a highscore list and the winner of this highscore list is called 'Kung Fotboll' (King Football).

With this app, we want to make it easier to keep track, make groups, set up the game play and if you're not able to be there, you can still see the groups and how they perform and afterwards every active player can watch the highscore list in real time.
